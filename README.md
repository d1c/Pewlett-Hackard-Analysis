# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview
  * Purpose of analysis is well defined.
The Pewlett Hackard company asked for an analysis of employees nearing retirement. The concern is that there is a large concentration of current employees nearing retirement. The purpose of the analysis is to make sure the company is prepared for upcoming employee retirements. To prepare for the eventual retirements this analysis will provide management information needed to make decisions and plan for the future.

## Results of Analysis
  * Bulleted List with four major points from the two analysis deliverables.
    * determine the number of retiring employees per title
    * identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program

## Summary
  * Summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight.

Based on the analysis performed there are a 72,458 employees nearing retirement. Having the information from this analysis now provides the company with opportunities to train and mentor younger employees while giving retiring employees a way to plan for their retirement. Without the information now at hand, the retirement of 30% of the company's employees in a short period of time could threaten the companies operations.

### Suggestions for further analysis
  1. Create a query to look at the Human Resources department staffing in more detail. Hiring and training the replacements for 30% of employees in a short period will create additional work load on HR employees. 
  2. After working with this database, another suggestion would be to redesign the database schema to make it easier to answer questions with the data. For example, one addition would be to help determine current employees vs. employes who have left the company. If this database will continue to updated and used this and other improvements should be made to make working with the data easier.
